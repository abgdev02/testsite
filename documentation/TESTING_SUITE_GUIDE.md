# Testing Suite Usage Guide

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Framework

The wellness meditation app now includes a comprehensive testing suite that automatically monitors and evaluates:

### 1. Accessibility Testing
- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Real-time checking for AA/AAA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and focus management validation
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic structure
- **Color Contrast**: Automated contrast ratio validation

### 2. Performance Monitoring  
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS tracking
- **Memory Usage**: JavaScript heap monitoring
- **Load Times**: Navigation and resource timing
- **Service Worker**: Cache hit rates and offline capability

### 3. Cross-Browser Testing
- **Feature Detection**: WebGL, Service Workers, CSS Custom Properties
- **Browser Compatibility**: Automated testing across major browsers
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Cross-browser performance comparison
- **Fallback Recommendations**: Suggestions for unsupported features

## 🔧 How to Use the Testing Suite

### Development Mode (Automatic)
When running `npm run dev`, the testing suite automatically:
- Initializes accessibility monitoring
- Starts performance tracking
- Runs cross-browser compatibility tests
- Displays results in browser console

### Manual Testing (Browser Console)
Open browser developer tools and run:
```javascript
// Run the complete testing suite
window.runTests()

// Individual test runners
window.accessibilityAudit()      // Accessibility-only test
window.performanceTest()         // Performance metrics
window.crossBrowserTest()        // Browser compatibility
```
